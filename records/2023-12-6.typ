== Last Week
After finishing the official English Exam, and submitted the application, which still has some required documents not uploaded.
Currently, I still working on modifying and formatting the academic transcript, which will be sent to the WES to process and send to the university, I have already informed to acquire whether I need to upload all required documents before the first deadline these days, but still no response now.
After this long period of not working on the current project, I have to make plans for what we will do next.

I don't know why Duolingo English test result will take that longer to send to the school, maybe I should change the name?

== Status

=== We currently can not handle code like:

```c
int global_a;

void f(int* x) {
  *x += 3;
}

int main(void) {
  f(&global_a);
  return 0;
}
```

That's what we can get:

```txt
global var: global_a
func f(x)
  block: entry
x: read count: 1, write count: 0
x.addr: read count: 0, write count: 1
func main()
  block: entry
retval: read count: 1, write count: 0
global: global_a: read count: 0, write count: 0
```

What we should get

```txt
global var: global_a
func f(x)
  block: entry
x: read count: 1, write count: 0
x.addr: read count: 0, write count: 1
func main()
  block: entry
retval: read count: 1, write count: 0
global: global_a: read count: 1, write count: 1
```

And also we have to get get the real changed across functions and files

=== We still only process single source file

Real-world projects won't only have one file, so we have to support multiple files and sync some data struct between each file process.

== Next Week

1. upload all required formal documents to CSSD, WES, Drexel

2. fix the bug that mentioned above
